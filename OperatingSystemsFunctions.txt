    One operating function would be the booting. Booting is important because it is when you turn on your computer and locate the OS to 
  start it up and get running. Sometimes you have multiple operating systems on your hardrive, so you have to change boot order in BIOS.
  
  Edit 1: Another operating system function would be the user interface. The user interface is important becuase it is how the user interacts with the operating system. That is why you should know which OS user interface is good for you, specially if you aren't
  tech saavy.
